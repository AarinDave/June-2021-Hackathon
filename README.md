# June 2021 Hackathon
This is the source code for the Coding Challenge and Thematic Project of the June 2021 Hackathon. Please note that the code will not improve over time, but there will be more of these types of repositories in the coming months.

## Coding Challenge

The Coding Challenge is about writing code in the least number of lines. There are some restrictions to what you can and cannot do, but this will not review the rules. I will display the best code for each question. Please note that I use Python 3.9.5 to complete all of the questions.

## Thematic Project

The Thematic Project is about creating a project of any programming language or framework given a theme. There are few restrictions to this event. This repository mainly contains the source code to the Thematic Project.
